# this will be a graphical app allowing the user to easily modify the json file used as input to the postprocessor. I
# will handle the compilation into an executable using auto-py-to-exe or similar. Feel free to use a different
# language if you want such as rust, c++, c, electron, etc. The app should have the following features: gets the path
# to the json file using a file dialog, displays the entries in the in a user-friendly format, allows the user to
# modify them and saves the changes as they type, allows the user to add new entries, allows the user to delete entries.
